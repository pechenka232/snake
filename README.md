I developed a classic game "Snake" in just a few minutes using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Phantom. My project was based on Sp 1 . During the work, I used the Node.js module, which allows scaling and improving the project. 

I have experience in developing games of varying complexity and am ready to create both simple and more complex game projects. I am also involved in blockchain development: I am proficient in Solidity and The Graph, I can write and optimize smart contracts. 

I am open to cooperation, especially in the field of crypto and Web3. If you have interesting ideas or projects, let's discuss!
